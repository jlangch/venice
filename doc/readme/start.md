# Getting Started

Welcome to Venice!

Venice can run on any operating system for which a Java VM is available, 
like Linux, MacOSX, or Windows.

 
 

## Venice Local Setup

### 1. Install Java

Venice requires Java 8 or newer.

Java can be downloaded from: 
- [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/de/temurin/releases/)
- [Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/)

The Venice JAR published to Maven is compiled with Java 8. Nevertheless Venice is regulary compiled and unit tested with Java 8, 11, and 17.


### 2. Get the Venice JAR file

Manually download the JAR from Maven: [Venice JAR](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.jlangch/venice/1.12.73/jar)

or download it with `curl`:

```
curl "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/jlangch/venice/1.12.73/venice-1.12.73.jar" --output ./venice-1.12.73.jar
```


### 3. Setup the Venice REPL

This automated setup will create a REPL launcher script with the Java *classpath*
correctly setup, will download the *Jansi* library from Maven, and add some example 
Venice scripts. The setups works on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

Open a terminal, move to the directory the Venice JAR is located, and start 
the REPL in setup mode:

```text
foo> java -jar venice-1.12.73.jar -setup -colors
```

For a REPL run in a darkmode terminal use the option `-colors-dark` instead of
`-colors`. This can also be changed later on by modifying the generated REPL 
launcher shell script `repl.bat` or `repl.sh` respectively.

The `-setup` option will cause the Venice setup to:
  - create a `libs`, `tmp`, `tools`, and `scripts` directory in the current working dir
  - install Maven locally to the REPL in the `tools` dir. Maven is used to download (if required so), 
    additional 3rdParty packages with its dependencies. It's only used when you need
    additional packages like the Apache-POI libraries for dealing with Excel files.
  - download the Jansi library from the Maven repository to the `libs` dir
  - extract some example Venice scripts to the `scripts` dir
  - create a launcher shell script `repl.bat` for Windows and `repl.sh` for all other OS

Now the Venice REPL can be started simply by executing the REPL launcher.

on MacOSX and Linux:

```text
foo> ./repl.sh
```

on Windows:

```text
foo> repl.bat
```


The REPL is started and prompts for input:

```text
Venice REPL: 1.12.30
Home: /Users/juerg/Desktop/test
Java: 1.8.0_392
Loading configuration from classpath custom 'repl.json'
Using Ansi terminal (light color mode turned on)
Use the commands !lightmode or !darkmode to adapt to the terminal's colors
Type '!' for help.

```

#### REPL setup directory structure (on MacOS / Linux)

```text
REPL_HOME
├── libs
│   ├── venice-1.12.73.jar
│   ├── jansi-2.4.1.jar
│   └── repl.json
├── tools
│   └── apache-maven-3.9.6
│       └── ...
├── tmp
│   └── ...
├── scripts
│   └── ... (example scripts)
├── repl.env
├── repl.sh
└── run-script.sh
```

#### REPL setup directory structure (on Windows)

```text
REPL_HOME
├── libs
│   ├── venice-1.12.73.jar
│   ├── jansi-2.4.1.jar
│   └── repl.json
├── tools
│   └── apache-maven-3.9.6
│       └── ...
├── tmp
│   └── ...
├── scripts
│   └── ... (example scripts)
├── repl.env.bat
└── repl.bat
```


### 4. Run expressions in the REPL

Type an expression like `(+ 1 1)` followed by a `<CR>`

```text
venice> (+ 1 1)
=> 2
venice>
```


### VSCode 

This VSCode **settings.json** file will establish syntax highlighting for Venice source files

```json
{
    "files.associations": {
        "*.venice": "clojure"
    },
    
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Tomorrow Night Blue",
    "redhat.telemetry.enabled": false    
}
```
