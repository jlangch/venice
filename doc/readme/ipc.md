# Inter-Process-Communication


Venice Inter-Process-Communication (IPC), is a Venice API that allows application components to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. It enables asynchronous and loosely coupled communication, making it ideal for distributed applications. Venice IPC works by either exchanging messages between a client and a server or using a messaging provider, such as a server, that routes messages from producers to consumers through queues with either a single consumer (point-to-point) or multiple consumers (publish-subscribe).
